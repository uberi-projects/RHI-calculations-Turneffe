# RHI Calculations Turneffe

This repository is intended to serve as a method for calculating Reef Health Indicator [values](https://www.healthyreefs.org/en/healthy-reefs-data/indicators/reef-health-index) for Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve data. 
Data are automatically pulled from the Dryad Data [Repository](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c866t1gcn) where they are located, and values are calculated for the entire dataset and exported as a summary report of the target year indicated.

**Using this Repository**

To use this repository, navigate to indicators_report.r and set the report_year vector to the target year. Run the script, and find your output summary report in the outputs folder.
